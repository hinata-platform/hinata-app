/// Motion design of a board card drag — shared by the Kanban board and the
/// Scrum surface so both walls feel like the same physical object.

/// The choreography deliberately keeps **one thing moving at a time**, so a
/// board with a dozen lanes never turns into a light show:
///
///  1. **Lift** — on grab the carried card scales up a hair and its shadow
///     grows, as if it left the surface. 190 ms, then it just sits there.
///  2. **Sway** — while carried, the card leans into the direction of travel
///     like something held by its top edge: a spring drives the tilt from the
///     horizontal drag velocity, so it swings out on a fast sideways move and
///     settles back with one soft over-swing when the pointer stops. Capped at
///     6°, never more.
///  3. **Socket** — the vacated spot stays exactly where it was, drawn as a
///     quiet empty recess. Nothing above or below it moves, so the column the
///     card came from never jumps.
///  4. **Slot** — the hovered column opens an accent slot at its foot, in the
///     dragged card's own height. It grows at the *end* of the list, so again
///     no existing card is pushed around.
///  5. **Landing** — after the drop the card scales out of that slot at its new
///     home with an accent ring that fades away once.
