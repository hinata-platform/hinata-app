/// The stage is near-black in *both* app themes — a lightbox shows its content
/// on a dark ground — so the chrome floating over it has to be authored for a
/// dark room whatever the app is set to. It was not: the bars read
/// `AppColors.inkSoft` & friends, and in light mode that put a dark violet-grey
/// on a lens that had carried the near-black stage through to a dull mid-grey.
/// The header line and the zoom bar measured 1.3:1 against it — legible only if
/// you already knew what they said (HIN-52).
///
/// Wrapping the viewer in [theme] is only half of the fix. It gets the *glass*
/// right, because [GlassFloatingSurface] resolves its tokens from the ambient
/// [Theme]; it does nothing at all for [AppColors], whose neutral getters
/// resolve against `AppColors.brightness` — a mutable global written once per
/// frame from the app's resolved theme in `app.dart`, which no local [Theme]
/// can reach.
///
/// So this class is the other half, and it is the *only* palette this file and
/// its part may use: reaching for an `AppColors` getter here is the bug, not a
/// shortcut. The values are the `…Dark` constants behind those very getters, so
/// light mode now reads the way dark mode always did — which was the mode that
/// was right. With one deliberate exception: [faint] is *not*
/// `AppColors.inkFaintDark` but a lighter tone of it, and since it took over
/// every place that token held, dark mode moved too — the text viewer's
/// line-number gutter went 3.76:1 → 5.55:1 on the dark paper and [_FileCard]'s
/// reason line 3.42:1 → 5.05:1 on the card. Both were under AA before; see
