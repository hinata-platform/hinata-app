/// A resilient Server-Sent Events consumer shared by every live view in the app
/// (comments, attachments, issue links, account sign-out).
///
/// It opens a stream via [open], parses frames to [onEvent], and keeps itself
/// honest about liveness. The failure that silently breaks SSE on mobile and
/// behind proxies is a *half-open* socket: the peer is gone but the OS never
/// reports the connection closed, so `onDone`/`onError` never fire and the
/// client waits forever on a dead stream — the view simply stops updating until
/// a manual reload. To defeat that, every received byte — including the server's
/// periodic heartbeat comments, which [parseSse] filters out — resets an idle
/// watchdog; if nothing arrives within [idleTimeout] the connection is treated
/// as dead and cycled with capped exponential backoff.
///
/// On every reconnect *after the first*, [onReconnect] fires so callers can
/// reconcile whatever changed while the stream was down. The first connect
/// deliberately does NOT fire it — the view's initial load already has fresh
/// data, so re-fetching on open would just double the work.
