/// name an **https** server, because the confirmation the caller shows is only
/// meaningful if the connection behind it is authenticated, but a plain `http`
/// server is accepted **only when the device already uses that exact URL**.
/// That keeps the self-hosted LAN and localhost setups this app supports
/// working, while refusing the one shape that is purely an attack: a link
/// introducing a brand-new unencrypted backend, on a screen that is about to
/// ask for a password.
///
/// The value is normalized the way [ServerUrlSubmitted] normalizes what the
/// connect screen accepts — trimmed, one trailing slash removed — and **the
/// path is kept**. `https://example.com/hinata` is a server this app supports
/// (a deployment behind a sub-path), and reducing it to its origin would point
