/// Where the OS share sheet should point.
///
/// On iOS and iPadOS the share sheet is a `UIActivityViewController`, and UIKit
/// requires the popover it may become to name a source rectangle. `share_plus`
/// forwards [ShareParams.sharePositionOrigin] as that rectangle and UIKit then
/// validates it against the presenting view's own bounds, refusing anything
/// that is not — in its words — "non-zero and within coordinate space of source
/// view".
///
/// That refusal is a `PlatformException`, not a fallback, and it is what broke
/// every export on iOS in 10.2.0:
///
/// ```text
/// sharePositionOrigin: argument must be set,
/// {{0, 157.2}, {393, 2188.5}} must be non-zero and within coordinate space
/// of source view: {{0, 0}, {393, 852}}
/// ```
///
/// The caller had passed the global bounds of the widget it was called from —
/// the issue sheet's scrolling body, 2188 points tall inside an 852-point
/// window. Perfectly ordinary as a widget, and impossible as a popover anchor.
/// A rectangle taller than the screen is not a rare edge case here: any
/// scrollable that is longer than one screen produces one, which is why this
/// rule belongs in one function rather than at each of the three call sites
/// that pass an origin.
///
/// Two rules, and both matter:
///
///  * **Inside the window.** The candidate is clipped to the window's bounds.
///    A widget scrolled halfway off the top keeps the part that is visible.
///  * **Never empty.** UIKit rejects a zero-sized rectangle as readily as an
///    oversized one, and `Rect.zero` is what the menu anchor falls back to when
///    its render object has gone. A degenerate result is replaced by a small
///    square at the same place, and a candidate that is off-screen entirely
///    collapses to the window's centre — the same place iOS puts a popover it
///    cannot anchor.
///
/// Elsewhere the value is ignored, so this is safe to pass on every platform
/// and there is no `Platform.isIOS` here to get wrong.

/// The share-sheet anchor for [context], preferring [preferred] when the caller
/// knows the exact control that was tapped.
///
/// [preferred] should be in global (window) coordinates, as
/// `box.localToGlobal(Offset.zero) & box.size` produces. Pass the button the
/// user actually pressed: the popover then grows out of it, which is what makes
/// an iPad share sheet look deliberate rather than dropped in the middle.
///
/// Read this on the frame the gesture arrives, before the first `await` — a
/// render object answers for the frame it was laid out in, and a share sheet is
/// always presented after at least one network round trip.
