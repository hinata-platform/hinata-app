/// itself is already right: `core/util/dates.dart` parses an instant and calls
/// `toLocal()`, which Dart answers from the operating system's own zone
/// database, per instant and daylight saving included. A PDF laid out on the
/// server has none of that context — the process runs with its clock pinned to
/// UTC so stored instants are deterministic, and an HTTP request says which
/// language the reader wants but never where they are. So the app tells it.
///
/// Why a plugin and not `DateTime.now().timeZoneName`: that answers with an
/// abbreviation, and abbreviations are not zones. "CEST" is shared by half of
/// Europe, "CST" by China, Cuba and most of the American midwest, and neither
/// says anything about when this year's transitions fall. A zone id does.
///
/// Read once and remembered. The value can change while the app runs — a phone
/// crossing a border, a laptop waking up elsewhere — and the refresh is left to
/// the next launch on purpose: the cost of being a flight behind is one export
/// stamped in the zone the reader left, and the cost of asking the platform on
/// every export is a channel round trip on a button press.
