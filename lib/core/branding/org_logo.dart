/// The organization's logo where the product's own mark used to be — the rail
/// header, the sign-in hero, the admin console, the consent card.
///
/// ### Why the API is shaped like this
///
/// There is deliberately **no `size`** and **no `color`**.
///
/// [HexMark], the mark this replaces, is a square [CustomPaint] taking one
/// `size`. An organization's logo is neither: it is a raster or vector of
/// whatever aspect ratio its designer chose, commonly a 6:1 wordmark. Offering a
/// square `size` here would reproduce, at every call site, exactly the bug this
/// widget exists to avoid — so the geometry is stated as a fixed [height] and a
/// hard [maxWidth], and the picture is fitted inside it. The box owns the
/// layout; the image never does.
///
/// A `color` would be worse. Twelve of the app's [HexMark] call sites tint the
/// mark to sit on their ground — and a tint is meaningless on a logo that
/// arrives with its own colours. Surfaces that genuinely need a tinted glyph
/// (watermarks, empty states, 18px list glyphs) therefore keep [HexMark]; that
/// is a decision, not an omission.
///
/// ### Behaviour
///
/// [fallback] is returned **verbatim** whenever there is no logo — not
/// configured, not loaded yet, failed, or no [OrgLogoStore] in scope (widget
/// tests, previews). So a surface adopting this never changes shape on an
/// instance without a logo, and the mark is never a reason for a blank frame or
/// a spinner. When the logo does arrive it cross-fades in, which is why the
/// fallback has to be the same size the logo will be.
