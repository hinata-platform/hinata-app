///  * **One request.** On native there is no HTTP cache in front of dio, so N
///    surfaces rendering the logo would mean N downloads. Concurrent callers
///    share one in-flight future; later ones get the cached result.
///  * **One decode.** A fresh `Uint8List` per fetch is a *new* [MemoryImage] as
///    far as Flutter's [ImageCache] is concerned — its identity is the buffer —
///    so re-fetching would fill the cache with duplicates of one picture. One
///    buffer here means one cache entry everywhere.
///  * **One failure mode.** The bytes come from a server the *user* typed in,
///    which may answer with anything at all. Deciding once what is renderable,
///    and capping what is accepted, keeps that judgement out of 20 call sites.
///
/// Fetching always goes through [MetaRepository.organizationLogo], i.e. the
/// server-side `/api/v1/meta/logo` proxy, and never through `meta.logoUrl`
/// directly: for an upload that value is a relative path with no host, and for
/// an external URL it is cross-origin — which the API's
/// `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` would block for a plain
/// `Image.network` on web.
