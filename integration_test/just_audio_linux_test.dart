/// Plays real audio through the plugin this repository ships for Linux.
///
/// The Dart-side unit tests in `packages/just_audio_linux/test` mock the
/// channels, so they prove the wiring and nothing about GStreamer. This one
/// runs inside the actual embedder with the actual plugin registered: if the
/// pipeline cannot be built, the file cannot be decoded, or the position never
/// advances, it fails here and nowhere else.
///
/// Run it on a Linux machine (or the repo's build container under Xvfb) with:
///
///     flutter test integration_test/just_audio_linux_test.dart -d linux
///
/// It needs an audio sink whose clock actually advances. A desktop has one. In
/// a container `autoaudiosink` may well pick one that does not — an openal or
/// pipewire sink with nothing behind it reaches PLAYING and then reports
/// position 0 forever, which fails the position assertion below for reasons
/// that have nothing to do with this plugin. Start a PulseAudio daemon with a
/// null sink and put its element in front of the others:
///
///     pulseaudio --start
