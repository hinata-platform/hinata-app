/// + fragment-shader pipeline *ungated* on every device — the expensive path that
/// also triggered shader-related production crashes on some Mali GPUs.
///
/// `GlassThemeHelpers.resolveQuality` caps any widget-level quality to the
/// scope's `effectiveQuality`. So proving `effectiveQuality` is never `premium`
/// proves no glass surface in the app can take the premium path.
///
/// This mirrors the exact config used at the app root; if that wrap is removed or
/// its cap is loosened to premium, this test fails.
