# Microsoft Store — Store listing (English)

Copy-paste source for Partner Center → hinata → Store listing – English.
Kept in the repo so the listing is reviewable and reproducible.

**This listing describes a Windows app and nothing else.** Certification 10.1.4.3
failed once on copy carried over from the Apple listing, so: no other platform,
no device that is not a Windows desktop, and no "on Windows … the same" phrasing
— a comparison implies the platform it compares to. Everything below is written
as if Windows were the only place Hinata exists.

1. **Push works, but not through Firebase.** `firebase_messaging` has no Windows
   implementation; the Windows build registers a **WNS channel URI** instead and
   the Connect gateway routes to WNS. It is a build detail, not listing copy —
   the listing just says notifications work.
2. **Three capabilities.** The MSIX declares `internetClient`, `microphone` and
   `webcam` (plus the automatic `runFullTrust`). The permission block below
   matches exactly what the Store shows under "This app can" — keep the two in
   sync whenever a capability is added or removed.
3. **Ctrl + K**, never ⌘K — in the copy and in the screenshots.

## Product name

    hinata

## Short description  (≤ 270 characters — currently 232)

    Open-source project and issue tracking on your own Hinata Server. Plan work on Scrum and Kanban boards, run sprints, follow a Gantt chart, track time and absences, and keep a knowledge base for your team. There is no per-user price.

## Description

**Source of truth: `windows/store/listing.json`** — that is the text the lane
actually pushes, so it is not duplicated here. Read it there, edit it there.

**Keep every other platform out of it.** Certification **10.1.4.3 App Quality –
Description** failed on 2026-08-17 (both language listings) on two leftovers
from the Apple copy:

- *"One app, every screen: desktop, tablet and phone …"* — describes the app on
  devices nobody can buy it on here; the package targets `Windows.Desktop` only.
- *"On Windows, Hinata runs as a native desktop app with the same full feature
  set."* — "on Windows … the same" reads as a comparison with another platform.

The replacement says the same thing without the comparison: a native Windows
desktop app that lays out from a snapped window to full screen. It also drops
the four-space indentation the old copy carried into Partner Center from being
pasted out of a Markdown code block.

## What's new in this version

Microsoft's guidance: *"Leave blank if this is the first submission for this
product."* Keeping a line is fine too — this one is accurate:

    Initial Windows release.

## Images

### Screenshots — `windows/store/screenshots/`

Five 2560 × 1440 desktop shots, in listing order, with the captions in
`captions.json` (en-us + de-de). Each is uploaded under a content-hashed file
name, so repainting an image always reaches Partner Center. Upload them with **Actions → "Windows listing
(screenshots)"**; `windows/store/update_listing.py` writes them into the pending
Partner Center submission through the Store submission API, for every language.

**Why they look the way they do.** The 2026-08-16 submission was rejected under
policy **10.1.1.3 Inaccurate Representation**: the images uploaded then were the
Apple-store compositions — a MacBook frame with macOS traffic lights. Store
metadata may not show another platform's UI or devices. The current set shows the
app in a plain Windows 11 window (title bar with minimize / maximize / close) on
the brand backdrop, and nothing else: Store guidance for the screenshot slots is
also explicit that they carry no extra logos, icons or marketing copy.

**The 2026-08-17 report kept 10.1.1.3 open**, on the replacement images — the
policy is read strictly, down to the pixels, so nothing from another platform may
survive anywhere in the frame. What was still in them, and is now gone:

- **⌘ in the demo content.** Two issue titles read "Wire ⌘K palette to project
  quick-switch". Fixed at the root in the server's `DemoSeeder`, and repainted in
  the two affected captures (`TEXT_PATCHES` in the generator).
- **Apple Color Emoji.** The comments screen shows reaction chips, which the Mac
  captures render in Apple's artwork. That screen is out of the set until a
  capture exists that does not come from a Mac.

Also keep in mind:

- The search hint must read **Ctrl K**, not ⌘K. The app renders it per platform
  (`searchShortcutLabel` in `lib/features/shell/app_shell.dart`) — before
  2026-08-16 it was hardcoded to ⌘K on every platform, which is what the first
  set of screenshots showed.
- Captions are per language; the app UI in the images is English for both
  listings.

Store logos — generated from `assets/branding/app_icon.png` into
`windows/store/images/` by `windows/store/generate_images.py`:

| File | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `poster-720x1080.png` | 720 × 1080 | 9:16 Poster art (main logo on Windows 10/11) |
| `box-art-1080.png` | 1080 × 1080 | 1:1 Box art |
| `tile-300.png` | 300 × 300 | Store display image — app tile icon |
| `tile-150.png` | 150 × 150 | Store display image |
| `tile-71.png` | 71 × 71 | Store display image |

The three "Store display images" are optional — without them the Store falls
back to the logos inside the package, which are already correct. The 9:16
poster is worth uploading: Partner Center marks it as the main logo shown to
Windows 10/11 customers.
